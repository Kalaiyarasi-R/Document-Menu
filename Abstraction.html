    <h2>Abstraction in Python :</h2>

    <p>
        Data abstraction is one of the most essential concepts of Python OOPs which is used to hide irrelevant details from the user and show the details that are relevant to the users. For example, the readers of geeksforgeeks only know that a writer can write an article on geeksforgeeks, and when it gets published readers can read the articles but the reader is not aware of the background process of publishing the article.

       A simple example of this can be a car. A car has an accelerator, clutch, and break and we all know that pressing an accelerator will increase the speed of the car and applying the brake can stop the car but we don't know the internal mechanism of the car and how these functionalities can work this detail hiding is known as data abstraction.
    </p>

    
    <p>
        Data abstraction in Python is a programming concept that hides complex implementation details while exposing only essential information and functionalities to users. In Python, we can achieve data abstraction by using abstract classes and abstract classes can be created using abc (abstract base class) module and abstractmethod of abc module.
    </p>
    <p>
        Steps to Create Abstract Base Class and Abstract Method:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Firstly, we import ABC and abstractmethod class from abc (Abstract Base Class) library
        </li>
        <li>
            Create a BaseClass that inherits from the ABC class. In Python, when a class inherits from ABC, it indicates that the class is intended to be an abstract base class.
        </li>
        <li>
            Inside BaseClass we declare an abstract method named "method_1" by using "abstractmethod" decorater. Any subclass derived from BaseClass must implement this method_1 method. We write pass in this method which indicates that there is no code or logic in this method.
        </li>
        

    </ol>
