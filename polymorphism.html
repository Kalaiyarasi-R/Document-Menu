    <h2>Polymorphism</h2>
    <p>
        Polymorphism in Python is the ability to use a single type of entity, such as an object, method, or operator, to represent multiple types in different contexts. The word "polymorphism" comes from the Greek words poly meaning "many" and morph meaning "forms".

    <p>
        The word polymorphism means having many forms. In programming, polymorphism means the same function name (but different signatures) being used for different types. The key difference is the data types and number of arguments used in function.
