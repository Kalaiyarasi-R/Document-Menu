        Inheritance
    </h2>
    <p>
        The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance. Inheritance is one of the most important feature of Object Oriented Programming. Sub Class: The class that inherits properties from another class is called Sub class or Derived Class. Super Class: The class whose properties are inherited by sub class is called Base Class or Super class. Using inheritance, we have to write the functions only one time instead of three times as we have inherited rest of the three classes from base class(Vehicle).

    <p>
        One of the core concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) languages is inheritance. It is a mechanism that allows you to create a hierarchy of classes that share a set of properties and methods by deriving a class from another class. Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class.

    <b>Benefits of inheritance are:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>It represents real-world relationships well.</li>
        <li> It provides the reusability of a code.</li> 
        <li> Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.</li> 
        <li>
            It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.Inheritance offers a simple, understandable model structure. </li>
        <li>Less development and maintenance expenses result from an inheritance.</li> 
    </ul>
